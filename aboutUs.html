            <p>Welcome to Laptop for All â€“ Empowering Futures Through Technology!</p>
            <p>At Laptop for All, we believe in the transformative power of education and the role that technology plays in shaping the future. Our mission is simple yet profound: to bridge the digital divide and provide free laptops to deserving students who lack the necessary resources to access the world of online learning.</p>
            <p>Our journey began with a vision to create equal opportunities for every student, regardless of their economic background. We understand that in today's digital age, access to a laptop is not just a luxury but a necessity for academic success. Many promising minds face barriers to their education due to financial constraints, and we are here to break down those barriers.</p>

        <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
        <div class="core-values">
            <p><strong>Education for All:</strong> We believe that education is a fundamental right, and no one should be left behind due to a lack of resources.</p>
            <p><strong>Empowerment through Technology:</strong> We understand the pivotal role that technology plays in empowering individuals and communities. By providing free laptops, we aim to equip students with the tools they need to excel in their studies and beyond.</p>
            <p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Laptop for All is not just about distributing laptops; it's about building a supportive community. We encourage collaboration, engagement, and a shared commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of students.</p>

        <div class="contributions">
